# Title: Summing Numbers

# Write a procedure called sumnums(). Your procedure must accept as input a
# single string. Your procedure must output an integer equal to the sum of
# all integer numbers (one or more digits in sequence) within that string.
# If there are no decimal numbers in the input string, your procedure must
# return the integer 0. The input string will not contain any negative integers.
#
# Example Input: "hello 2 all of you 44"
# Example Output: 46
#
# Hint: int("44") == 44

import re

def sumnums(sentence):
    return sum(map(int, re.findall(r"[0-9]+", sentence)))


# My original way:
def sumnums_mine(sentence):
    numbers_to_sum = re.findall(r"[0-9]+", sentence)
    result = 0
    for number in numbers_to_sum:
        result += int(number)
    return result

# Another (more elegant) way:
def sumnums_elegant(sentence):
    return sum([int(found) for found in re.findall(r"[0-9]+", sentence)])

# Peter's way:
def sumnums_peter(sentence):
    r = r"[0-9]+"
    sum = 0
    for found in re.findall(r, sentence):
        sum = sum + int(found)
    return sum
         

# This problem includes an example test case to help you tell if you are on
# the right track. You may want to make your own additional tests as well.
